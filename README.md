This is my implementation of the well-known game 2048 using CSS, HTML, and JS.

  - [DEMO LINK](https://Masha-Cactus.github.io/2048_game)

Here are the rules of 2048:
1. The Grid: The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
2. Starting Tiles: The game begins with two tiles already on the grid, each with a value of either 2 or 4.
3. Moving Tiles: You can move the tiles using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). When you move a tile, it slides as far as it can in the chosen direction until it hits another tile or the edge of the grid.
4. Combining Tiles: If two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. For example, two 2 tiles will merge into a 4 tile.
5. New Tiles: After each move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 will appear in a random empty space on the board.
6. Goal: The goal of the game is to create a tile with a value of 2048.
7. Ending the Game: The game ends when you create a 2048 tile, or when you can no longer make any moves (i.e., the board is full and no tiles can be combined).

Regarding the placement of 2 and 4 tiles:
- When: A new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 appears after every move you make.
- Where: The new tile appears in a random empty space on the board. You cannot control where it will appear.

Key Points:
- Only tiles with the same value can combine.
- Tiles can only move in one direction at a time.
- The game is over when you create a 2048 tile or when you can no longer make any moves.
- Strategic thinking and planning are essential to succeed in 2048.
